I know this one's going to be tough as hell for some of y'all excuse my French but I got to keep this 100% real bro if it's one thing I do I got to keep this 100% real the first sign that you are a Manchild is that you still blame people for the fact that you're not where you want to be in life and not just in life let me correct that the first sign that you are a Manchild is the fact that you still point fingers and complain at other people because you're not where you need to be in your life it's not just in life it's your life and I think that's what men forget sometimes is that your life is your responsibility your life you have to be accountable for that 100% man Can't Nobody Do that work for you y'all know can't nobody do it for you can't so when you a Manchild you still think somebody could do the work for you you you still think somebody is going to do the work for you you still actually think that you're where you're at in life and it's somebody else's fault instead of taking accountability some of y'all still holding on to grudges because your parents didn't to do a good job some of y'all still upset that you ain't had no dad growing up most my childhood for real mama was the was the one for me man mama mama raised me single mom I'm not mad at anybody we're winning we're doing great we're elevating because it's my life it's my responsibility and Mama did a great job and I'm grateful for that but if she did a bad job I'd still be grateful because God still woke me up and life is still my responsibility my life is still up to me and that's a good thing y'all think that's a bad thing y'all think that that's more stress you think that that that that that's more pressure but that's actually a very good thing because it means that you can do something about it you can make something happen you can make your life better you have the power to do that you got the power to change things around your life doesn't have to look like how it's been looking for the past five 3 4 years it can look different if you do different things if you put the work in if you show up for yourself your life could look totally different so you're a Manchild because you're thinking that it's somebody else's fault you're blaming people you're pointing [Music] fingers right let me be honest I live in America right now you know everything kind of expensive bro you you feel me and you know I stay out of the you know but I'm just saying everything kind of expensive and whoever our leader is right now he ain't doing too too good and the reason I bring that up is I could be pointing fingers and saying because of who's in charge the economy is bad and I'm not happy about that and it's their fault why I don't have no money instead of taking it into my own hands and saying well if I got to get a second job so be it that's the purpose-driven mindset if I got to go harder then so be it if I got to work more then so be it and also trusting that God is going to make a way for you as well that's the true leader right so guys man we can complain about everything we could complain about money we could complain about who's in leadership we could complain about our life we could complain about our friends get better friends you have the power to do that nobody is keeping you in this like this little holding cell you guys think that you know you're you're somewhere and you can't move please stop thinking that please understand that you have the power to move you have the power to create change you have the power to transform your life you got the power to do that you are powerful beyond measure but the problem is you try to measure you try to measure how powerful you really are and you always come up short you always come up short cuz that's not the true answer you don't think that you could do anything about your life but you can do everything about your life it's your life so you're a Manchild when you think that it's other people's fault for why you're not where you're supposed to be at number two you're a Manchild if you don't know how to handle yourself emotionally I was looking at video footage of a you know a celebrity out in Hollywood I don't want to say no names I don't need my channel being you know no drama Channel nothing like that but it was bad it was really bad and he was beating on this girl beating on this girl beating on this girl I'm talking about this is a billionaire this is a a wealthy man bro a man that definitely has something to lose on top of that the morality is not there where's your morals you don't put your hands on no woman you don't put your hands on nobody unless somebody is literally trying to harm you or harm your loved ones okay but he was beating on his girl somebody that he said that he loved beating on her you know why the emotional intelligence is not there I don't care how intelligent you are about making money I don't care how intelligent you are about being a public figure and being you know a celebrity none of that matters when you putting your hands on people that you shouldn't be putting your hands on bro none of that matters none of that matters we have to be emotionally intelligent and now your legacy and everything that you work for it's all gone to waste because you don't know how to control your emotions you got angry with somebody instead of talking it through and expressing how you feel in that moment as men we can't always result to let me put my hands on you that's some Childish things bro that's very childish bro we got to be more mature we got to have more a more mature approach we have to a real man knows a real man ain't putting his hand on a woman and a real man understands the value of talking talking through things being a emotionally mature will save you from a lot of those situations being emotionally mature will help you when times are tough that's very important what really separates a boy from a man is that boys don't really know how to control their emotions so they cry you know they cry a lot you know they uh throw Tantrums that's what I mean when I say cry cuz if you a grown man and you crying you that's okay especially if you alone you at home you going through a tough time that that's okay bro [Music] but you're not supposed to be crying every day all day you're not supposed to be throwing Tantrums every day all day like little boys do we got to find a way to okay we cry all right then we got to we got to keep going but with boys they they stop and they throw Tantrums they throw Tantrums ah because you didn't get your way well understand that life is not fair and you may never get your way but you still got to keep on going you still got to keep on going so emotional intelligence is highly important and understanding that you're responsible for your life is highly [Music] important what else makes you a Manchild you're a Manchild if you chase Comfort versus fulfillment babies want to be comfortable they want to be comforted they want kisses they won't love you have to understand as a man you might you might not get that bro it might be a lonely season for you we know as men we don't even get compliments y'all know people don't even compliment us like that y'all know don't expect praise don't expect love if you expect love and you expect Praise You are a Manchild because only children expect love and expect praise they expect a job well done but as men the only expectations we need to have is of ourselves did we put the work in today did we do good today did we achieve our goals and dreams today those are the expectations that you need to have stop expecting people to love you stop expecting people to shower you with praises stop expecting people to compliment you you may never get that you got to believe in yourself enough you got to love yourself enough you got to respect yourself enough another reason why you could be a Manchild bro is that you are not working on having your own in life oh Malik I'm 18 I still live with my parents is that okay of course that's okay of course that's okay as long as you're working towards getting out of there we have to work towards having our own here's why it's important to be self-sufficient I just want you guys to be self-sufficient I want you guys to be able to be independent as a man because once you're independent you're able to have dependence a dependent means that somebody is dependent on you and your success and your money maybe you guys want to retire your mom one day you want to help her out with the bill so she don't got to work as hard well that means that you have to turn her into a dependent and that only happens when you become independent as a man that means you're putting in the work that means you're grinding you're working hard you're being disciplined to the point where your mom is able to not work another day in her life because she raised you that's what I want to happen for me that's what pushes me to go forward right we got to learn to be independent if I was still in my mama house it' be hard for me to take care of her one day because I'm getting comfortable I'm chasing comfort I'm chasing Comfort I care about being comfortable instead of saying let me go out into the real world and let me let me face the realities of the world let me have my own so I can give back to my mom and speaking on Comfort again remember we need to be chasing fulfillment and fulfillment is that feeling that you get when you do everything that you say you were going to do for the day that's important don't forget that striving for your own striving to have your own you know how good you're going to feel when you finally have your first apartment you have your first apartment you know how good that feels come on man I know that feeling it's a great feeling I got the keys to my own house right it's not me bragging or boasting I got the keys to my own spot because I put the work in and I got to pay rent every month nobody could pay it for me I'm not expecting nobody to pay it for me I'm not expecting a miracle to happen I'm expecting to put in this work another sign that you are a man child is you still do childish things all day every day 247 hey one thing that I love right I love NBA 2K I love NBA 2K I love watching basketball I love playing basketball right and I love playing basketball on my PS5 and what I had to realize bro is I had to put that  down for a little bit bro you know I put games Away really for about 3 years I just got games back I used to play on my Xbox one every day after school I used to play all day every day all day every day and then I asked myself can I sacrifice something that I love so I could start the work and Chase my goals and dreams instead and that's what I did my freshman year of college my sophomore year of college and my junior year in college I gave all my Xbox One games and all that to my little brother I don't play games no more now I started to play games a little bit because I realized that I'm no longer a slave to the games I could put in the work I'm getting closer to my goals so when I want to you know have a little bit of fun I put the games on especially because I don't party or go out to drink or do none of that stuff so you know The Games Keep Me Happy The Games Keep me relaxed so as a man I'm not saying you can't play games what I'm saying is can you sacrifice if you're not willing to sacrifice that's childish just for a little bit can you go without can you test yourself to see are you really the man that you say you are are you really disciplined and I'm telling you you know a lot of the times when you keep playing video games 24/7 what do you think is happening it's taking time away from what really matters it's a distraction and the one thing that I hate is distractions it's action over distractions action over distractions all day every day we got to put the work in we got to put the action in we got to you keep playing with childish things you keep doing childish things as a child I would play my game every day cuz I could I was a child but as a man I got a schedule I got things to do I got things to [Music] complete another sign that you are a Manchild is that you don't have a to-do list you just going with the flow you just think that you so smooth you got everything in your head please write it down please write it down one of y'all brothers let me shout out brother Sahar we talk every single month do you know what Sahar is doing he writes down every single one of these videos to help himself improve he writes down notes not only is he taking notes he has a to-do list and some of y'all don't have a to-do list you just moving with the flow it's important to take notes it's important have a to-do list it's important to know what you got going on in your life it's important to write it out but see we don't become writers anymore we got to write we got to read we got to critically think use the tools that is given to you even if you got to write in your notes on your phone just write down in your notes bro today this is what I have to do children go throughout their day and they don't really have a to-do list why because their parents are telling them wake up their parents are telling them go to school their parents are telling them do your homework their parents are telling them eat dinner oh my God everything is made for you you just got to live you just got to hop in the car somebody's taking care of you somebody is taking care of you somebody is taking care of you but as you grow older as a man you realize you have to take care ofself you have to take care of self you got to take care of yourself you got to take care of yourself which means you got to make schedule yourself another sign you're a Manchild is you don't know how to cook or fetch for food or do your laundry the basics the basics every human being it doesn't matter if you a man or a woman everybody need to know how to cook how to clean how to take care of themselves because that's what it means to be independent and self-sufficient that's what it means to build your kingdom you know how to do these things you don't want to depend on people you want to be able to be independent and if somebody can come into your life and they can help you cook or cook for you then that's a blessing but you should know how to at least cook eggs bro I can't cook much but I could cook eggs and if I had to cook you know chicken and stuff like that then I could do it but I got a girl and she helps me out and I'm very thankful for that I'm very grateful for that and I do things that she don't have to worry about as of right now I'm covering rent she's very thankful for that everybody got their role to play but let me tell you bro when she's sick you know I'm I'm making breakfast I'm doing my best because I I have that skill now it ain't hard to make eggs but damn it you need to know how to make something so you can [Music] survive My mama taught me how to do laundry I know how to do my laundry I may not be as skilled I may not be as great as doing these things I may not be 100% with chores but I at least know the basics so I could be independent and as a man you have to try to do the basics so you can be [Music] independent nobody's going to care or cater for you 100% that's what children are looking for mama can you do this mama can you do that but when you a man it's bro you on your own you on your own I love y'all I feel like this is a solid list this was off the The Dome off the top man off the you know what I'm saying so I love y'all I hope that y'all can take something from this and I'll see y'all in the next video peace [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
