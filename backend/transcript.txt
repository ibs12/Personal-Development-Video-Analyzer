become an attractive character my name is Colin and I'm a student at Yale University studying computer science and music and in this video I'll give you a list of the most sexy and Powerful skills to learn in 2025 if you look at people like Bruce Wayne Leonard Da Vinci and Joe Rogan they're all attractive characters they're all jacked nerds who are skilled at many different things Bruce Wayne power martial arts strategy Da Vinci Science math art Joel Rogan podcasting comedy and UFC these people are multi-dimensional these people are polymaths what is a polymath in super simple terms a polymath is a renaissance man it's someone who's skilled at many different things a polymath is in my opinion the most attractive and desirable archetypes of men in the modern world so how do you become become a polyat now the first attractive skill you want to learn is meta learning meta learning is learning how to learn and this is perhaps the most powerful skill on this list so for example if you're a student in high school or college you want to learn how to study effectively look my biggest Flex is not that I go to Yale or I got a 4.0 GPA in high school but it's the fact that I did it while studying 2 hours max a day it's the fact that I know that I can Ace any subject any exam in a fraction of the time and that's because I've learned how to learn learn and the main technique that I use is active recall where instead of just reading the textbook I'm learning by answering questions now when I talk about active recall is not just for studying it's also for learning new skills so for example in the past 30 days I've been trying to learn a new programming language react to make iOS apps and the way I've been learning is not just by reading a textbook that's pish posh but it's by starting my own project I'm actively learning by doing so for any skill you want to learn in 2025 learn by actually doing the work if you want to get better at studying and get better grades actually do the practice problems don't just read the textbook if you want to learn a new language don't just learn the Theory actually practice speaking it out loud this is how the genius learns his skills guys learn how to learn learn how to think don't become a theorist become a practitioner now the second attractive skill on this list is to master AI when I talk about mastering AI I'm talking about using it to make your life easier imagine you're Tony Stark a I is like your Jarvis one of the best ways you can use AI is to learn things faster so for example if you want to learn how to code a website or build an app you can use chbt to learn or cursor AI now the goal is to use AI to spend the least amount of time in getting the most results also you can use AI as your personal coach it's actually a superpower so for example try typing in this prompt in Chach from all our interactions what is one thing that you can tell me about myself that I may not know about myself you will be surprised if you give AI enough input about yourself it's actually super useful it'll help you strategize your life and help you learn more about yourself it help you design a life that's exciting and fun and you can ask chpt questions like oh I'm having a problem what would Bruce Wayne do if he were me guys if you can Master new technology and use AI to your advantage you become super powerful and that's how you become a modern polymath now the third attractive skill on this list is working out yes becoming a jack nerd is super bad ass think Joe Rogan or think of Mark Zuckerberg 2 years ago he was just another Rich nerd now he's completely ripped he fights surfboards and makes music his Aura is now different if you want to glow up in 2025 working out is perhaps the easiest thing you can do to become more attractive personally I like going to the gym three times a week and I'm trying to build that aesthetic fighter physique I'm also in the Yale kickboxing club and I do around 8,000 steps of walking each day guys anyone can go from a four in attractiveness to an eight simply by working out consistently and for most people going to the gym is probably the easiest way to build muscle and to look more lean also once you have a pretty good physique you get all the benefits as you get older so if you're a teenager or in your 20s go to the gym it's one of the best investments you can make you'll look more attractive feel healthier and also become much more mentally sharp now the next sexy skill on this list is content creation if you can't code write books and blogs make videos and
